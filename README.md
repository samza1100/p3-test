# p3-test
# Our program remains unfinished as we were unable to integrate the API into our project due to the absence of our peer responsible for that aspect. 
# Despite our combined efforts, both in interface design and algorithm development, we have been unable to complete the program due to the unavailability of the Spotify API.
# So this is just portion of the program that we have completed without the integration of the Spotify API.

# This repository is divided into two main parts. The first part are the source code, which including header files, cpp files, and ui files. 
# The second part consists of the executable program packaged as a zip file. 
# To run the program, simply unzip "p3Application.zip" and execute the "p3-test.exe" file contained within.
